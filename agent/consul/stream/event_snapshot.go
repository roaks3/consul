package stream

// EventSnapshot represents the state of memdb for a given topic and key at some
// point in time. It is modelled as a buffer of events so that snapshots can be
// streamed to possibly multiple subscribers concurrently, and can be trivially
// cached by just keeping the Snapshot around. Once the EventSnapshot is dropped
// from memory, any subscribers still reading from it may do so by following
// their pointers but eventually the snapshot is garbage collected automatically
// by Go's runtime, simplifying snapshot and buffer management dramatically.
type EventSnapshot struct {
	// Request that this snapshot satisfies.
	Request *SubscribeRequest

	// Snap is the first item in the buffer containing the snapshot. Once the
	// snapshot is complete, subsequent update's BufferItems are appended such
	// that subscribers just need to follow this buffer for the duration of their
	// subscription stream.

	// snapBuffer is the Head of the snapshot buffer the fn should write to.
	snapBuffer *EventBuffer

	// topicBufferHead stored the current most-recent published item from before
	// the snapshot was taken such that anything published during snapshot
	// publishing can be captured.
